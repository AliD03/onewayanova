Description: This package is written in R in order to find the values of the oneway-anova table.
    It also finds the Fisher's LSD values as well. This package has written in a way that can work
    with both list and dataframe as an input which gives flexibility to the user. The output of anova
    is printed very nicely which means it gives so many information in a very few lines. Moreover
    this package is displaying the input by in boxplots which are side by side each others.
